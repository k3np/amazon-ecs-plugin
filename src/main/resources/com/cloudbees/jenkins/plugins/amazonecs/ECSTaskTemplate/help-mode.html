Controls how Jenkins schedules builds on this agent.
<dl>
    <dt><b>Use this node as much as possible</b></dt>
    <dd>
        In this mode, Jenkins uses this node freely. Whenever there is a build
        that can be done by using this node, Jenkins will use it.
    </dd>

    <dt><b>Only build jobs with label expressions matching this node</b></dt>
    <dd>
        This is the default setting.
        <br>
        In this mode, Jenkins will only build a project on this node when that
        project is restricted to certain nodes using a label expression, and that
        expression matches this node's labels.
    </dd>
